              Optimizing Your Website By Extracting Unused CSS from HTML Files
            </h1>

            <p>
              The optimization of efficient code is one of the most important
              roles in a web developer's life. Your website's CSS files can
              quickly bloat up with unused styles over time, especially if you
              are using a very popular framework like Bootstrap or working with
              pre-built templates. These unused styles will ultimately slow down
              your website and make your code difficult to handle. In this post,
              we'll learn how to extract and remove unused CSS from your HTML
              files using tools such as <strong>PurgeCSS</strong> and
              <strong>UnCSS</strong>. We will further look at explicit
              scenarios, for example, when working with CSS frameworks and
              ready-built templates, and talk about some online tools at your
              disposal which let you simply paste your HTML and CSS to quickly
              optimize them.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Problem with CSS Frameworks</h2>

            <p>
              CSS frameworks like <strong>Bootstrap</strong>,
              <strong>Tailwind</strong>, <strong>Foundation</strong>, and many
              more are really good ways of speeding up your development process
              by quickly giving you responsive, rich-featured websites. All of
              these frameworks, however, come along with a large volume of CSS
              that you might never use. Here's an example:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <a
                    href="https://getbootstrap.com/"
                    class="external-link"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    ><strong>Bootstrap</strong></a
                  >: A full-fledged framework with styles for buttons, forms,
                  modals, tooltips, and lots of other elements. If your project
                  uses only a few of these components, though, the rest of the
                  CSS goes to waste, ballooning your file size.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <a
                    href="https://tailwindcss.com/"
                    class="external-link"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    ><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong></a
                  >: Although Tailwind championed a utility-first methodology,
                  encouraging one to use only those classes that one needs, a
                  typical Tailwind installation still comprises thousands of
                  utility classes by default.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why This is a Problem</h3>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Performance Impact</strong>: Every style not in use adds
                to the size of your CSS files, meaning increased download time
                and, correspondingly, slower page loads.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Complexity</strong>: It's difficult to maintain a huge
                CSS file with lots of unused styles as your project grows.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Overhead</strong>: More CSS files give the browser more
                work to do when rendering your page.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Removing Unused CSS from Frameworks</h2>

            <p>
              One may do this using tools like <strong>PurgeCSS</strong> and
              <strong>UnCSS</strong>. Both these tools extract only the used CSS
              in your project to solve this issue.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a
                href="https://v1.purgecss.com/"
                class="external-link"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >Using PurgeCSS with Frameworks</a
              >
            </h3>

            <p>
              PurgeCSS works really well for projects which use a CSS framework.
              You can specify which HTML and JavaScript files should be scanned
              to make sure that only the styles really used in your project are
              kept.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Example</strong>: Setting up PurgeCSS in your build
              process if you're using Bootstrap:
            </p>

            <pre><code data-highlighted="yes" class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Purgecss</span> = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'purgecss'</span>)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> purgecss = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Purgecss</span>({
      <span class="hljs-attr">content</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'**/*.html'</span>],
      <span class="hljs-attr">css</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'**/*.css'</span>]
    })
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> purgecssResult = purgecss.<span class="hljs-title function_">purge</span>()
    </code></pre>

            <p>
              This configuration will look through your HTML and JavaScript
              files for any Bootstrap classes being used, and remove the rest.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Tailwind CSS Example</strong>: Tailwind CSS has native
              support for PurgeCSS, which provides even easier removal of styles
              that are not used. Configuration is done in your
              <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file as follows:
            </p>

            <pre><code data-highlighted="yes" class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">module</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">exports</span> = {
      purge: [<span class="hljs-string">'./src/**/*.html'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'./src/**/*.js'</span>],
      <span class="hljs-comment">// other config options</span>
    };
    </code></pre>

            <h3>
              <a
                href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uncss"
                class="external-link"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >Using UnCSS and Frameworks</a
              >
            </h3>

            <p>
              With UnCSS, you can remove unused CSS from frameworks. This
              solution, though generally easier to set up for small projects, is
              quite powerful for static site setups using Bootstrap.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Dealing with Pre-Built Templates</h2>

            <p>
              Another common scenario is you start with a pre-built HTML/CSS
              template, and then you further modify it to your taste. You might
              delete some HTML elements or even sections that you don't need,
              but the related CSS stays there, bloating your stylesheet for no
              reason.
            </p>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Template Complexity</strong>: Most pre-built templates
                come with solid CSS that covers a wide range of components and
                complex layouts. As soon as you begin the process of removing
                HTML elements, related CSS is left over, unused and possibly
                perplexing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Manual Cleanup</strong>: It's time-consuming and full of
                errors to remove by hand unused CSS from a template in a big
                project.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Automated Solutions</strong>: In such scenarios, tools
              such as PurgeCSS and UnCSS really show their worth. They will
              delete CSS that is no longer in use once you have made changes to
              your template.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Optimize a Customized Template</h3>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Parse the HTML Files</strong>: Run the tools, PurgeCSS
                or UnCSS on your HTML files after modification.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Remove Unused CSS</strong>: Both of these tools
                auto-delete any CSS rules no longer applying to the new
                structure of the HTML.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Test and Refine</strong>: Always test your website
                thoroughly after running these tools to make sure that no
                essential styles were removed by mistake.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              This approach ensures that the CSS used by the remaining HTML
              elements is retained.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">
              Extracting Unused CSS Using Online Tools
            </h2>

            <p>
              On top of the above mentioned CLI tools, there are quite a lot of
              online tools to which you can just paste your HTML and CSS to
              quickly <code>purge unused styles</code>. Particularly, these
              tools become handy for small projects, quick tests, or where you
              want a fast, easy way to clean up your CSS without setting up a
              build process.
            </p>

            <h3>Here are a few popular online tools</h3>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <a
                  href="https://uncss-online.com"

              <li>
                <p>
                  UnCSS Online is a no-brain, easy tool. You paste your HTML and
                  CSS, and it returns cleaned-up CSS. Perfect for small, quick
                  tasks and smaller projects.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>

                    href="https://purifycss.online/"
                    class="external-link"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"

              <li>
                <p>
                  The PurifyCSS Online tool allows you to enter the ulr to the
                  website or simply paste your HTML and CSS directly into a web
                  interface. This way, you have a preview of what CSS it is
                  going to purge without having to wire it up directly in your
                  project. This tool is awesome, especially if you're playing
                  with a few different configurations and testing before
                  integrating it into your project.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>

              <li>
                Even though it is a CSS minifier, it goes further to decrease
                the file size by eliminating excessive CSS. You can paste your
                CSS into their online interface to quickly optimize it.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How to Use These Tools</h3>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Paste Your HTML and CSS</strong>: Paste your HTML and
                CSS into text boxes on that tool's site.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Run the Tool</strong>: At the click of a button, the
                tool goes through your HTML and CSS and purges all the unused
                styles.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Download the Optimized CSS</strong>: At the completion
                of the process, a download button appears, clicking on which you
                can download a cleaned CSS file to replace your old, heavy
                stylesheet.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Pros of Online Tools</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Convenience</strong>: Nothing to install or configure.
                Just paste and go.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fast Feedback</strong>: Ideal for trivial changes or if
                you are short of time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Configuration</strong>: Ideal for non-developers, or
                those who don't want to set up build tools.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Not Good for Large Projects</strong>: These tools are
                not so great on large complex projects. In that case, build
                tools like PurgeCSS will be a better fit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Limited Customization</strong>: You may not get to
                control the process as one would in a locally installed tool.
              </li>
            </ul>

              For your CSS to stay optimized while working with these, the
              following will be of great help:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Modular Frameworks</strong>: This means picking
                frameworks, if possible, that allow you to import only the
                components that you really want (for instance, Bootstrap's
                modular CSS files).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Integrate PurgeCSS or UnCSS Early</strong>: Include
                these tools in the beginning of your build process. This will
                help keep the CSS optimized since your project will evolve.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Watch Out and Clean Up</strong>: Keep an eye on your
                CSS—especially after big changes to your HTML—for unused styles
                and remove them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Be careful with Dynamic Content</strong>: Be careful
                while working with these tools on dynamic content. Make sure
                styles for elements that may or may not exist within the HTML at
                any given point—think modals, dropdowns—do not accidentally get
                scoped and removed.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>
              Extracting unused CSS is a crucial step toward optimizing your
